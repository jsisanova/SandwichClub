## Project Overview
Sandwich Club App , created as a part of Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Program.
In this project, I completed the **Sandwich Club** app to show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Why this Project

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for  this project will
help you to better understand how it is processed.

## What Will I Learn?
Through this project, I have learnt:
- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly

I designed the layout for the Detail Activity so the different elements
display in a sensible way. I implemented the JSON parsing in JsonUtils so it
produces a Sandwich Object that can be used to populate the UI that I designed.
